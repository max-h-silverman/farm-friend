# Farm Friend — Session Log

Newest-first, on-demand build history: what was built each session, the decisions and rationale
that aren't obvious from the diff, and what was verified/owed. The **live snapshot** of what's
true/unfinished now lives in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) "Current State & Open Items"; this file
is the *why behind past changes*.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase 0 built (F-006a + F-006b + F-006c), verified, not committed

Branch `feature/f-006-platform-spine` (off `main` = `3f76949`, the archived scaffold; the working
tree was the intentional clean-slate wipe). Built the full Phase-0 spine test-first, per the
approved plan (`we-re-building-farm-friend-generic-clock.md`). **Not committed** — the user
directed no commit/push/deploy without explicit go-ahead.

**PM restructure first (via `/pm`).** Split the oversized F-006 three ways (F-006a docs, F-006b
spine, F-006c auth+evals); added F-007a/b, F-008, F-009; reframed F-002 (publish, two-axis
provenance), F-003 (open-intent inquiry), F-005 (console consolidation, with flag review pulled
out to F-009 as a hard pre-launch gate). Dependency order encoded via table position + "Depends
on" notes. Reconciled `product.md` (coordinator framing, `contracts` package, two-axis migration
model, code-enforced-safety golden rule). ID strategy: kept existing IDs, rewrote in place. F-006
retained as a `wont-fix` stub recording the split.

**F-006a — docs + CLAUDE.md.** CLAUDE.md in Nudgenik house style; the `docs/` set reading in order
via `docs/README.md`. Key decisions captured: the **two-axis migration model** (lifecycle `status`
= shown-on-map vs. provenance = honesty-about-age; migrated shows as `current` but is labeled
honestly, never "confirmed today"), the **sharpened type-safety claim** (branded types make it a
*compile error to bypass* the assembler/redactor — provenance, not content; the runtime scan +
adversarial evals prove content), the **`ai_runs` MAY-store list**, and the **abuse/cost throttle
seam** location (decided in ARCHITECTURE, built in F-003/F-008).

**F-006b — spine.** npm-workspace monorepo (`core`, `db`, `sms`, `ai`, `config`, `contracts`) +
web/mobile shells + 5 scripts. Tenant-scoped Drizzle schema with the restored columns
(`farm_stands.claim_status/migrated_at/migrated_source/visibility/lat/lng`, `farms.status`,
`inventory_snapshots.status+provenance+confirmed_by_person_id`), nullable-FK+text stock-out shape,
gleaning tables (designed, unused), `ai_runs` (no model input). Provider seams: `SmsTransport`
(+simulator +Telnyx stub +**outbound redaction guard**), `LLMProvider` (+stub +openweight
+**`ModelSafeContext` assembler** +validate-and-repair), `Clock`, `MapProvider` (+**offline
stub**). The **branded type-level safety boundary** — `ModelSafeContext`/`RedactedOutbound` whose
only public constructor is the assembler/redactor; a deliberate bypass fails `tsc`, **proven
non-vacuous** (removing a `@ts-expect-error` makes `tsc` fail: "string not assignable to
RedactedOutbound"). The **generic commitment state machine** designed against two consumers
(publish/activation + gleaning): context-bound, exactly-once, expiring. First unit tests cover all
eight named invariants.

**F-006c — auth + evals.** Magic-link auth (issue/verify, HMAC signature + expiry code-enforced),
a server-side `requireRole` helper (admin⇒staff implication + tenant match) used by routes, plus a
web callback route and a role-guarded admin route. The eval harness (`evals/run.ts`, run via
`tsx`) with critical/advisory groups and the **adversarial group** that proves — by exercising the
*real* assembler + commitment machine — that an injected SMS can't smuggle a phone into context or
force a commit. **Proven non-vacuous**: neutering the assembler's phone scan fails the adversarial
group and exits non-zero.

**Notable engineering decisions.**
- Relative imports are **extensionless** (`moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, source-first workspace
  consumption) so both `tsc -b` and Next's webpack resolve them; Next couldn't resolve `.js`
  specifiers pointing at `.ts` source.
- React pinned to `18.2.0` across web + mobile to satisfy React Native 0.74's exact peer.
- Integration suite is `DATABASE_URL`-gated (skips cleanly) so `npm test` stays hermetic and
  CI-without-a-DB doesn't fail; it runs against local/Neon Postgres when the URL is set.

**Verified this session:** `npm run typecheck` PASS, `npm run lint` PASS, `npm test` **38 passed
(9 files)**, `npm run test:integration` 3 skipped (DB-gated), `npm run evals` critical 3/3 +
advisory 2/2 + adversarial 4/4. `apps/web` builds and live-served `/api/health` (200), the Telnyx
webhook (deterministic routing through core — `STOP`→global compliance, free-text→`none`), the
magic-link callback (bad token→401), and the guarded admin route (unauth→403). `apps/mobile`
type-checks.

**Owed / next:** commit + PR when the user gives the go-ahead. Run the integration suite against a
real Postgres to exercise the schema + seed. Then the launch set: F-007a → F-007b → F-002 → F-008
→ F-003 → F-009.
