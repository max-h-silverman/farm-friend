# Farm Friend — Current State & Open Items

> **Live snapshot, overwritten by `/session-wrap` — not a changelog.** Durable contracts live in
> the architecture docs; session history lives in [SESSION_LOG.md](SESSION_LOG.md).

## Release state

- Farm Friend is **pre-go-live**. Production serves SMS stock-out reporting, broad-inquiry paging
  and stand details. F-104's customer→farmer alert path is closed and proven on a real handset.
- Cloud Run web `farm-friend-web-00067-mlf` and worker `farm-friend-worker-00062-qlw` serve immutable
  digest `sha256:47cc0e3fe54599a178e5b24358d3938f0643b91b82e266dc1bcc29b242d6b1a0`, built from `main`
  `99db95d` and deployed 2026-08-11. Plan assertions 60/60; deploy and served-card assertions pass.
  The serving digest was read back and matches the build.
- Neon `neondb` has **40 applied migrations (`0000`–`0039`)**. `0039` was applied 2026-08-11 ahead of
  the image that reads it and verified by schema effect: `referenced_stand_item_id` present and
  nullable, both new constraints present, and farm/stand/item/report counts unchanged across it.
- **B-057 is live but unproven on the live path.** A stock-out alert can now name one of the stand's
  usual offerings, not only its published inventory. No production report has named one yet — that
  needs a real inbound text, and it is what closes the item.
- **The SMS answer format is LIVE and read on a handset** (F-107 + B-061, both closed 2026-08-11).
  One entry per stand — name, street address, `IN STOCK (23h ago): …`, `MAYBE: …` — replacing the old
  "Confirmed <item>:" / "typical offering" sections, and no "may be out of date" phrase (the age
  carries it; the map keeps its explicit warning). A broad question ("what do you have") was
  **answered rather than deflected**, proving B-061's code check on the real inbound path. The
  `MAYBE:` line is still unproven live — all three stands in that reply were confirmed-only.
- **This repo has no CI.** There are no workflow files and `gh pr checks` reports none, so a green PR
  page means nothing on its own: the local suites are the only gate before a merge.

## Verification

- `main`: 1,877 unit tests, **913** local integration tests, typecheck, and lint pass (2026-08-11).
  The web production build retains the tracked Next configuration/lint warnings (B-008).
- Local integration tests need Postgres on `localhost` and are run with `npm run test:integration:local`.
  `psql` is not on the default PATH (`postgresql@16` lives under Homebrew's `opt`), so a bare
  `psql`/`pg_isready` reports "command not found" — that is **not** evidence the database is absent.
- Stub evals pass critical 11/11, advisory 4/4, adversarial 29/29. The real DeepInfra model scores
  containment 5/5, closure 7/7, recall 5/5, quality **19/20** (2026-08-11). Note the per-category
  counts exceed the fixture count — several fixtures score multiple cases. B-057 added one quality
  fixture, proving the stock-out seam picks a usual offering out of a mixed candidate list; it passed
  7/7 runs.
- **Broad availability questions are answered by CODE, not by the prompt** (B-061 defect 4, closed
  2026-08-11). The model classifies "what do you have" as `ambiguous` **even when that exact phrase is
  written into the instruction as never-ambiguous** — measured 10 runs out of 10, and 0/7 across the
  family in the deploy-day live run. `isBroadAvailabilityRequest`
  (`packages/core/src/inquiry/broad-request.ts`) overrides `ambiguous` toward answering when a message
  has shopping grammar and names no product; measured 27/27 end to end where the model alone was 5/21.
  The live fixture now scores "N model + M code" so a regression in the check surfaces as an unrescued
  case instead of hiding behind the model's score. **Do not "fix" that fixture by trimming it to the
  cases the model passes — the failing phrasings are what the code check exists for.**
  The check holds **no food or farm vocabulary** and a test asserts that against its own source; a miss
  is closed by extending the grammar, never by adding a crop word.
- **Live evals are nondeterministic** in two distinct ways, and both must be held apart. Roughly one
  run in three shows a provider error, labelled `[provider error, not a verdict — rerun]` and scored
  as a FAILURE on purpose: the seam returns the same `clarification` shape for "unreachable model"
  and "model declined", so accepting any clarification let an unreachable model read as correct.
  Separately, one B-056 fixture returns real but wrong verdicts in ~2 of 7 runs (B-058) — so a
  single live run cannot distinguish a regression from that noise.
- Deployment assertions confirm both revisions are newer than every mounted secret; the served contact card
  has the expected E.164 suffix, 153 bytes, CRLF-only lines, and all seven required properties.

- `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` runs on **VIGA's own account** (Secret Manager v3, 2026-08-11). Proven by
  effect in production; the old personal-account key is revoked and returns 401.

## Standing facts a cold start needs

- Farmer onboarding sends the farmer to text **VIGA** from their stated handset; `START` remains the
  carrier recovery fallback. Telnyx sends the opt-in receipt; Farm Friend sends only the listing-live link.
- Onboarding validates on submit, returns the farmer to the earliest incomplete step, and shows only that
  step's missing fields. The address action is **Save**; unresolved addresses are refused, never approximated.
- VIGA Farm Bucks is a farmer-owned acceptance claim, stored apart from the payment-method list. `LINK`,
  `STAND`, and `SETTINGS` retain their existing farmer update behavior.
- A dated stock claim has exactly one provenance: `sms`, `web`, or `viga`. Onboarding inventory waits for
  verified handset redemption before publication.
- `visitability` controls the map invitation. A contact-only farm may be placed, but gets no directions link.
- Broad availability inquiries expose only the first three selection candidates to the model; code keeps the
  validated remainder in deterministic order for `MORE`. A broad request is recognized by **code** when the
  model calls it ambiguous, so the customer is answered whichever model is installed.

## Open before go-live

- Finish physical-handset checks: farmer onboarding, consent, vCard, paged SMS, administrator/settings,
  and F-105’s stand-detail sheet at phone width in both appearances; verify VIGA’s Squarespace embeds and
  the `?hidden=true` behavior.
- F-065: attribute every listing change to its actor; F-084: decide participant attribution during onboarding.
- B-008, B-034, B-036, F-101, and B-048 remain planned.
- **VIGA's call, not a code question:** whether the Vashon Island Farmers Market belongs in the
  roster as a farm at all — it is the market itself, not a stand with a farmer to onboard.
- **B-057 owes one live check:** text a stock-out for an item a stand carries as a usual offering
  but does not currently publish (Pinecone Gardens' eggs is the original case), then confirm the
  farmer's alert names it and the report stored `referenced_stand_item_id`. Until then the fix is
  proven only by test.
- B-058: one B-056 live fixture returns wrong verdicts in ~2 of 7 runs — fix or make it score
  `correct/total`, but do not loosen it until it always passes.
- **Three defects the live check exposed, all in the deployed customer answer** (2026-08-11, from
  one real "what do you have" reply — none is a regression of B-061 or F-107):
  - **B-063** (high): `IN STOCK (16d ago)` — a 16-day-old claim under a present-tense label, ranked
    above stands with no confirmation, with no warning. F-107 dropped the stale phrase on the theory
    the elapsed time carries it; at 16 days the label contradicts it. Worst customer-facing of the three.
  - **B-062** (high): the count says "1-3 of 45" over 35 stands — it counts facts, not stands,
    because F-107 merges by location at render time and the page window was never moved with it.
    A dual-basis stand can therefore repeat across a MORE boundary.
  - **B-064** (normal): `IN STOCK: Veggie` — a raw `stand_items.display_name` printed as a stand's
    whole answer. Same corpus rows as B-059; this is its customer-facing half.
- F-108 (idea): a per-answer `MAP:` link resolving to a view of just those stands. Blocked on nothing;
  it is a new public surface plus a stored per-answer code, so it was kept out of F-107.
- B-059, B-060: B-057's follow-ups — measure the seam against the corpus's genuinely awkward lists
  (Tian Tian's "bok choy" vs "Baby bok choy"; Bart's Cart's overlapping plant items), and prove by
  sabotage that a hostile `stand_items.display_name` stays inert in the farmer's alert. Both are
  quality risks: a wrong pick names the wrong item, and nothing published moves either way.

**Unverified at phone width** — jsdom reports every element as zero-sized, so these are covered by
tests but not by eye: the farmer agreement step, F-067's onboarding listing form and its map,
F-090's four-step wizard, F-097's restyled surfaces (the settings panel, the saved-confirmation
screen, the onboarding cadence control, the map card's recency caption), and **F-100's three admin
tabs** — the farm directory row collapses to three columns under 34rem, unchecked by eye. Per-tranche
browser checks are **not tracked here** (max, 2026-08-05): he runs a browser pass himself before
go-live.

The 2026-08-10 farm-card hierarchy pass was measured in Chrome (computed styles, no overflow at
390px) against **the components rendered on the real stylesheet, not `/admin/farms` itself** — admin
login and seeded farms were never exercised. A multi-stand farm, a removed farm, and a stand reading
"off the map with the farm" are unseen in that new styling.

## Traps worth not rediscovering

These are now stated where the work happens — **RUNBOOK.md** owns them: the migration-generator traps
(§Migrations), the deploy and secret-rotation traps (§Deploy, §Credential rotation), the corpus and
seeding traps (§Seeding), and production Neon's reachability from a dev machine (§Failure triage).
Codebase-level gotchas live in **DEVELOPMENT.md** §gotchas.
